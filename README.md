A python library where you can download the data of the queries that you created in Dune Analytics.

Built using Duneanalytics and Python.

## How does it work?
The library can be used to fetch the table data from python backend, doesn't run the query.

The original [repository](https://github.com/itzmestar/duneanalytics).

To see some queries examples you can visit my [dashboards](https://dune.com/datactuary) page.
